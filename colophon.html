  <h1>Colophon</h1>
  <p>There is nothing really interesting in here. This is just the updated version of Sergio's Personal Cabinet, as I want to separate the things I do on the BBJProjeK organization, and my own thoughts. Cabinet will still be updated for The Authority docs, and XasPos is still going to update there.</p>
  <p>Here you'll find some personal thoughts and other stuff.</p>
  <h2>Website</h2>
  <p>As on previous generations, the website is built from scratch, all the HTML and CSS is manually written by me (although I grabbed some css ideas from other blogs), and the whole repository is publicly available at <a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/seeergiofdez/sergio">seeergiofdez/sergio↗</a>.</p>
  <p>In my desire to make a really lightweight but modern html5 website (with pages around 8-36 kB without images), I had to divide stylesheets and scripts so this way I only add the necessary features for each HTML page. This was already a thing on cabinet, and still following this principle.</p>
  <h2>Cookies and tracking</h2>
  <p><b>No,</b> the page does not store cookies. If you find one, it’s probably a bug, and I’d appreciate if you’d let me know. No external info or iframes will be shown here.</p>
  <p>I don’t use any kind of analytics. This page is hosted on GitLab Pages and I try not to hotlink to external sites. Also, as I always did, this page is designed to last. I use almost every principle that Jeff Huang specifies in their post: <a target="_blank" href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">This Page is Designed to Last↗</a>. I use vanilla HTML/CSS, I use as few pages as possible to retain information, I don't hotlink, and I use native fonts.</p>
  <h2>Why under bbjprojek.org domain</h2>
  <p>It's an excellent question that I don't know how to address, I am too lazy to find a personal domain that convinces me, and for me, bbjprojek was initially a personal project, and so I will always use this domain as a personal thing, as well as my email.</p>
  <h2>Credits</h2>
  <p>This page was done thanks to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://cabinet.bbjprojek.org/">Cabinet↗</a>: I don't wanna sound self-indulgent, but, really, this page is inherited directly bloody from it. Not only the idea, but the css, etc. </li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.avas.space/">Ava's Blog↗</a>: Based on Bear Blog, I really loved the idea of a minimal blog, but I wanted it to be self-hosted, so I grabbed some things from it and implemented on my css :p.</li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://chris.funderburg.me//">Chris Rants at Clouds↗</a>: Minimal website, powered by Hugo (PaperMod). Gave me some ideas for the blog too.</li>
  </ul>
