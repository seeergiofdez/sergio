  <h1>I'm Fine with my Screentime</h1>
  <time>Dec 1, 2025</time>

  <p>I recently realized I don’t care about screentime anymore.</p>
  <p>It used to be that big evil number, and I get why; if you doomscroll through reels, get stuck on feeds and social media for hours, waste time in Slack channels and all that, it’s a problem. A shocking metric. But when you’re off of that, what’s the harm? I don’t have unnecessary apps or notifications, no social media, no news addiction, not busy with keeping up on Slack. Natively built-in screentime tracking was invented for all that, yet I can’t exclude essential apps from its time tracking, thus it loses its nuance and purpose.</p>
  <p>What’s the harm of an 5 hour screentime if it was for 3 hours of driving and having maps open? Why should I care about an hour of YouTube if I was cooking some meals during that time? Or that other hour of digitally reading a book, or using it for work? My screentime is around 3 or 4 hours a day because of Waze, Spotify and writing in the Notes app, too. So? It all serves me well.</p>
  <p>Anyways, I guess I'm a phone person in all the right ways. I find extremely useful to use digital reminders and calendar, or being able to send pictures, and share knowledge and stuff to friends; Having all kinds of lists in the notes app. Having maps on there, all the alarms and timers. I’m seeing kind emails from strangers and interesting messages from friends… it’s not a stress rectangle if you don’t design it to be.</p>
  <p>So I don’t see a reason to be on my phone less just to reduce a number. Just focus on other things that matter more than that.</p>
