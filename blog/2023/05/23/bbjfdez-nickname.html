  <h1>About BBJFdez Nickname</h1>
  <time>May 26, 2023</time>

  <p>It's about <b>February 2016</b> when I first inmerged into the open world of internet.</p>

  <p>One of my first social network that I remember using/enjoying was <a href="youtu.be">YouTube</a>. I didn't upload but watched so many videos.</p>
  <p>I remember joining <a href="https://aminoapps.com/c/tecnoamino/home/">Tecnología Amino</a> back at <b>August 31th, 2016</b>, just some minutes after watching <a href="https://youtu.be/SYFEESARS24">Top 5 Apps Android Septiembre 2016</a> from Topes de Gama (<i>formerly "Andro4All"</i>), from Jaume Lahoz.</p>
  <p>I didn't get used to this new social media platform at first, but eventually did start to post and upload blogs. I quickly escalated in there and started to be recognized on the platform. By 2017 it was my favourite social network platform and one.</p>

  <h2 id=an-unique-nickname>An Unique Nickname</h2>
  <p>By the time I joined, back at August 2016, <a href="https://aminoapps.com/c/tecnoamino/page/user/ntn-42b/kwqJ_MMxi4fYzPKgWeXG76npDjpRXZnDz4NuQ">NTN-42B</a> (also stylized <i>ntn42b</i>) was the main leader and the creator of <a href="https://aminoapps.com/c/tecnoamino/home/">Tecnología Amino</a>.</p>
  <p>Him being explained. I just noticed that "Sergio Fernández" was not enough to be recognized, I wanted an unique nickname for me to be recognized.</p>
  <p>BBJFdez it's easier than you might be thinking; following his layout. The first three laters (<b>B</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>J</b>)... The following letters (<b>Fdez</b>) are just the spanish abbrevitation for "Fernández". So that makes <b>BBJFdez</b>.</p>
  <p>I quickly used this nickname for all my social platforms and online accounts (by that time they might be; Twitter, Instagram, DEV.TO, Medium, and other platforms).</p>

  <h2 id="the-organization">The Organization</h2>
  <p>By that time, <a href="https://github.com/thegabrielhoward">Gabriel Howard</a> and I decided to create a placeholder to develop, host and publish some Android projects (ROMs, kernels and other things we've been doing).</p>
  <p>The organization borns in Getafe. Founded in June 2019. With the name no more basic as my nickname then. <b>B</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>J</b>, already explained, and "<b>ProjeK</b>", which means "project" in Malay)... That made <a href="https://bbjprojek.org">BBJProjeK</a>.</p>
  <p>That way BBJProjeK starts releasing projects and expanding the community.</p>

  <h2 id"=the-deprecation">The Deprecation</h2>
  <blockquote><i>If it was a nice and unique nickname... Why did it die?</i></blockquote>
  <p>The answer is easy; because it <b>lacked meaning and originality</b>.</p>
  <p>Also because the apparition of nice (more basic) alternatives make me rethink of my nickname. It's about January 2020 and after making a small research of my friend's Instagram and other platforms nicknames when I realized I needed a more descriptive nickname (i.e. a more basic one).</p>
  <p>My friend's nicknames were as basic as using <i><b>name+surname</b> plus some repeated vocal or consonant for that unique username</i>. That formula makes <i><b>dynelaarsen</b></i> for someone called <i>Dyne Larsen</i> or <i><b>palomagarrcia</b></i> for someone called <i>Paloma García</i>.</p>
  <p>So yeah, I was as dumb as recreating my "unique" nickname by using my name and surname... that made <b>seeergiofdez</b>. Nice... now I entered the basic nickname community... But at least I used that nickname for every platform, and not a different one (this makes easier for anyone to find me on any platform, and sometimes this might be a disadvantage).</p>

  <h2 id="present">The Present</h2>
  <p>It's 2023 and I'm still using this nickname. Well, I think this is the forever nickname. It's simple (like I am) and it's descriptive. So why changing again?</p>
  <p>I mostly use this nickname for some social network that I still use, or platform. But as many know, I'm leaving social presence, so many social networks have been deleted.</p>
